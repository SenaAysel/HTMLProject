<p>A thin flexible strip of plastic or other material coated with light-sensitive emulsion for exposure in a camera, used to produce photographs or motion pictures.
A story or event recorded by a camera as a set of moving images and shown in a cinema or on television.The word "film" is actually undergoing an evolution at the moment, which makes it quite an interesting word. From a technical point of view, film is a format. By that I mean film is the actual material that a movie is recorded to in production and projected from in a cinema. Over the last fifteen years there has been an explosion of new digital technology entering the movie production process. So, although most cinema movies are still shot and projected on 35mm film, this is no longer universally true. And, there is a growing trend in cinema projection away from showing a movies film and projecting digitally.
It's important to understand this technical revolution, because although film as a format is in decline, the usage of the word "film" is changing. </p>
